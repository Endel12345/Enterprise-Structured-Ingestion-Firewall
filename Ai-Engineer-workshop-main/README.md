# Enterprise Structured Ingestion Firewall

A beginner-friendly AI project. You chat with an AI assistant in a React web app, and for every message the backend:

1.  Understands it.** An LLM sorts the message into a fixed category (payment issue, order tracking, greeting…) and returns structured JSON. Pydantic checks that JSON before anything else uses it.
2.  Answers it.** A second LLM call uses that checked JSON to write a helpful reply in Markdown.
3.  Remembers it.** Every conversation is saved in a **SQLite** database, so follow-up questions ("what about my other order?") make sense and you can reopen old chats.

The "firewall" idea: the AI's output is not trusted until it passes a strict schema. If the model returns a category that doesn't exist or a missing field, the app rejects it.

## What you will learn

- Building an API with **FastAPI**
- Calling a cloud LLM (**Groq**) from Python
- Getting **structured output** from an LLM with **Instructor**
- **Validating** data with **Pydantic**
- Saving chat history in **SQLite** (built into Python, no server needed)
- Building a **React + Vite** frontend and connecting it to an API

## Key words (quick glossary)

| Word | Meaning in this project |
|---|---|
| **LLM** | Large Language Model, the AI that reads and writes text. We use one hosted by Groq. |
| **API** | The backend URLs the frontend calls, e.g. `/api/analyze`. |
| **FastAPI** | The Python library that runs our API. |
| **Pydantic** | Checks that data has the right fields and allowed values. |
| **Instructor** | Makes the LLM reply in a shape that matches our Pydantic model. |
| **Schema** | The rules for what valid data looks like. |
| **Intent** | What the user wants, e.g. `payment_issue`. |
| **Session ID** | A unique ID for one conversation, so the backend knows which history to use. |
| **SQLite** | A database stored in a single file (`backend/data/chat.db`). |
| **React / Vite** | React builds the UI from components; Vite runs it in development and builds it for production. |
| **`.env` file** | A private file holding your API key. Never share or commit it. |
| **venv** | A private Python environment just for this project. |

## How a message flows through the app

```text
 You type in the React app (http://localhost:5173)
        │
        ▼
 POST /api/analyze { message, session_id? } ──► FastAPI backend (port 8000)
                                                  │
     1. Check the input                 schemas/ingestion.py
     2. WEEK 1: classify it             services/llm_service.py      ── LLM call #1
          └─ Pydantic validates the JSON
     3. Estimate tokens                 utils/token_counter.py
     4. WEEK 3: load recent history     services/database_service.py ── SQLite
     5. WEEK 2: write a reply           services/response_service.py ── LLM call #2
     6. WEEK 3: save both messages      services/database_service.py ── SQLite
                                                  │
        ◄──── JSON: intent details + response_markdown + session_id
        │
 The chat shows the answer; the right panel shows intent, risk and priority
```

## What you need

- **Python 3.10 or newer** (check with `python --version`)
- **Node.js 18 or newer** (check with `node --version`): https://nodejs.org
- A free **Groq API key**: https://console.groq.com/keys
- Internet connection

## Run it (Windows PowerShell)

You need **two terminals**: one for the backend, one for the frontend.

### Step 1: Set up the backend (one time only)

```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You'll know the venv is active when your prompt starts with `(.venv)`.

### Step 2: Add your API key (one time only)

```powershell
copy .env.example .env
notepad .env
```

Replace the placeholder key with yours, then save:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_real_key_here
GROQ_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-120b
```

No database setup is needed; the SQLite file is created automatically.

### Step 3: Start the backend (Terminal 1)

Still inside `backend`, with `(.venv)` showing:

```powershell
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Check it at http://127.0.0.1:8000/health. You should see `{"status":"ok",...,"database":"sqlite"}`. Leave this terminal running.

### Step 4: Start the frontend (Terminal 2)

Open a **new** terminal in the project root:

```powershell
cd frontend-react
npm install        # first time only
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Open the app

Go to http://localhost:5173 and click **Get Started**. The sidebar dot is green when the backend is connected.

To stop the servers, press `Ctrl + C` in each terminal.

On macOS/Linux, use `source .venv/bin/activate` instead of `Activate.ps1`, and `cp` instead of `copy`.

## Where is my chat history?

In `backend/data/chat.db`, created the first time the backend starts. Ways to look at it:

- In the browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/conversations
- In VS Code: install the **SQLite Viewer** extension and click the file
- To start fresh: stop the backend and delete the `backend/data` folder

The database is in `.gitignore`, so your chats are never pushed to GitHub.

## Common problems

| What you see | Why | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Red dot / "Backend offline" in the app | Backend isn't running | Do Step 3 |
| `npm` is not recognized | Node.js isn't installed | Install it from https://nodejs.org and reopen the terminal |
| `{"detail":"Not Found"}` at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ | Normal: there is no `/` route | Use `/docs` or `/health` |
| `502 The AI request failed` | Wrong key, or the model name doesn't exist | See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md#troubleshooting) |
| `Activate.ps1 cannot be loaded` | PowerShell blocks scripts | Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` once |
| Port already in use | An old server is still running | Press `Ctrl + C` in its terminal, then start again |

## Good to know

- Each message makes **two** LLM calls (classify, then answer).
- The assistant uses the **last 12 messages** of a conversation as memory.
- The app does **not** really look up orders or reset passwords; it only classifies and gives advice.
- Token counts are **estimates**, not what Groq bills.
- Schema validation checks the **shape** of data, not whether the AI's answer is true.
